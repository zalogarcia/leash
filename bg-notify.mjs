// What the owner actually sees when a background worker starts and finishes.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. Every handoff notification used to read:
//
//   🌙 Handed to the background lane: LANE RULES (you are a background worker:
//   headless, no tmux, no terminal). These are runtime facts, not preferences:
//   1. NEVER use run_in_background: not on Bash, not on an Agent/Task dispatch…
//
// — identical for every job, carrying zero information about which job it was.
// Two independent changes combined to guarantee it: bg.mjs prepends ~1,400
// characters of LANE RULES to every brief, and the notice clipped the first 240
// characters of the composed text. The clip window never reached the task.
//
// A previous pass widened that window from 120 to 240 in response to the same
// complaint, which only bought MORE boilerplate. Widening is not the fix: the
// preamble has to come off BEFORE anything is clipped, and what is shown after
// that should be the brief's own title rather than its first 240 characters.
//
// These are pure string functions on purpose — they are the part that was
// wrong, so they are the part that has to be testable without a daemon, a
// Telegram token or a live worker. See bg-notify.test.mjs.

// title rule and the repo scan, so an edit to the rules cannot silently

# Restart the Leash service WITHOUT killing an in-flight run.
#
# Polls until the daemon has no claude child processes (no run in progress),
# then restarts the service. Prefer this over a fixed-delay restart
# (`sleep 45 && restart`): mid-task steering lets a run extend past any
# guessed delay, and a timer that fires mid-run kills the daemon's own child —
# the reply being composed dies undelivered.
#
# Invoke detached from inside a bridge-driven Claude run:
#   nohup ./safe-restart.sh >/dev/null 2>&1 &
# The invoking run is itself a child of the daemon, so the script naturally
# waits for the current reply to land before restarting.
#
# Usage: safe-restart.sh [--allow-bg] [timeout-minutes]   (default 15; on
# timeout it restarts anyway — same behavior as a fixed delay, but only as a
# last resort, and it logs that it did.)
#
# --allow-bg: restart as soon as the CHAT lane is idle, without waiting for
# background workers. Background workers are detached and survive a restart
# (see README, "Background workers outlive the daemon"), so waiting hours for a
# long job to end is a cost with no matching risk.
#
# What the flag DOES cost: a worker in flight loses its steerability. The daemon
# holds its stdin, so when the daemon goes the worker reads EOF, finishes, and is
# re-attached on the next boot exactly as before, but `bg.mjs steer` can no
# longer reach it and `bg.mjs ps` will show it as `steerable: no`. Without the
# flag, behaviour is unchanged: the restart waits for every child.
#
# It costs a background CODEX job more than that, and knowingly: its app-server
# child is on the daemon's stdio pipes, so the running turn dies with the daemon
# and the next boot resumes the thread with a fresh, billed continuation turn.
# The work is not lost (the thread is on OpenAI's side); the turn in flight is.

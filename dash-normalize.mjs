// DASHES OUT OF THE PROSE, ON THE WAY TO THE PHONE
//
// The owner's standing rule for their own copy is no em dashes, anywhere, on any
// channel. Claude has been trained off them by their CLAUDE.md; Codex has not,
// and its replies arrive full of them. That is the whole reason this exists:
// the bridge is now a two-engine product and the second engine writes in a
// register the first one was told not to.
//
// It is a normalizer, not a lint. A lint tells you afterwards. This runs on the
// outbound reply for BOTH engines, so the message they read is already right.
//
// The two characters appear here ONLY as \u2014 and \u2013 escapes, never as
// literals, so this file passes the same no-dash check every other file in the
// repo is held to and a grep for a stray dash finds real ones.
//
// WHAT IT WILL NOT TOUCH, and why each one is load-bearing:
//
//   inline code spans and fenced blocks
//       `foo --bar` and a shell script are CODE. A dash inside them is a flag,
//       an operator or a heredoc marker, and rewriting one turns a copyable
//       command into a broken one. This is the failure mode that makes a
//       normalizer dangerous rather than merely wrong.
//   URLs
//       a hyphen in a path is part of the address. En dashes do not occur in
//       one, but a URL sitting in prose must come out the other side byte for
//       byte or the link 404s.
//   <<<...>>> markers
//       the handoff block's own framing, which the injection path relies on.
//   HTML tags
//       the reply is rendered to Telegram HTML downstream, and this runs BEFORE
//       that, so there is nothing to protect yet. Kept in the contract anyway:
//       if it ever moves, it must not eat a tag.
//
// WHERE IT LIVES. This belongs in md-format.mjs on the merits: it is a pure
// text transform in the same layer as mdToTelegramHtml, and that is where the
// brief asked for it. md-format.mjs is a SHARED module, byte-identical with the
// public repo, and scripts/check-shared.sh fails on any drift. Adding a
// function there without also touching the public repo (which this job may not)
// would break that guard, so it sits here instead, in one file with no other
// job, ready to be pasted into md-format.mjs the day the public port happens.

 *                                   writes it.
 *   "a <em>"    becomes  "a."       a dash that ENDS a clause is doing a full
 *                                   stop's job, so it becomes one. Detected by

 *   "3<en>5"    becomes  "3 to 5"   a digit range, where the en dash means "to".
 *   "a <en> b"  becomes  "a - b"    every other en dash is a hyphen.

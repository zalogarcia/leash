// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// WHICH ENGINE, PER LANE, AND WHAT CODEX RUNS WITH
//
// The bridge was built on Claude with Codex bolted on as a fallback. That is
// backwards for anyone whose primary engine IS Codex, and Leash will have those
// users: some with a ChatGPT subscription and no Claude account at all. So the
// engine is a per-lane SETTING here, not a rescue path:
//
//   config.json  engine: { chat, bg }   the install-wide default, set once
//   /engine codex | claude              this chat's chat-lane engine
//   /engine bg codex | claude           this chat's background default
//   codex: / claude: prefix,            per job, beats everything above
//   --engine codex|claude
//
// Resolution order, highest first: an explicit per-job engine, then the chat's
// stored setting, then the config default, then claude. Availability can veto
// any of them (a missing binary is not a preference), and the rate-limit
// fallback can promote claude to codex, but ONLY for a lane that expressed no
// preference and only while every Claude account is walled.
//
// THE LOOP GUARD is structural rather than a check: nothing in this module can
// see whether a previous run FAILED. A Codex failure therefore cannot make the
// next decision come out claude, and a Claude failure cannot make it come out
// codex except through rotationPausedUntil, which only a real account wall
// sets. There is no input here to ping-pong on.
//
// Pure: no filesystem, no process, no clock of its own. bridge.mjs passes the
// state and the availability in, which is what makes engine-state.test.mjs able
// to prove a Codex-first boot with no `claude` binary anywhere.

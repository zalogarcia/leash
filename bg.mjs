// The Leash daemon drains this drop-box each poll cycle (<=~1 min) and runs the
// text in its own background Claude session, streaming progress to Telegram.
// The calling session is free immediately.
//
// Workers are unbounded: if one is busy, the daemon spawns another, so several
// handoffs run in PARALLEL rather than queueing behind each other.
//
// When the job finishes, its output is delivered to the CHAT lane as a worker
// report — the assistant decides what to do and gives you a short update.
// Raw output never goes straight to your chat. History: bg-results.jsonl.
//
// A background worker is a SEPARATE session: it does not see your conversation,
// so write each task self-contained. Its result does NOT come back into your
// current turn — use it for "go do this and report", not for work whose result
// you need in order to answer right now.
//
// `steer` is the alternative to killing a worker: it writes one more instruction
// into a RUNNING worker's stdin, keeping the context it has already built. Kill
// and re-dispatch only when the brief itself was wrong.
//
// `btw` is the same pipe with the OPPOSITE framing: a side question that is
// explicitly not an instruction, answered in one message and then dropped, with
// the worker carrying on exactly where it was. Use it for "which repo are you
// in" and "did the migration apply"; use `steer` when the job has to change.
// The answer goes to the Telegram chat, not to this terminal: the daemon is the
// only thing watching the worker's stream. Availability is IDENTICAL to steer,
// so the STEER column of `bg.mjs ps` answers both questions.

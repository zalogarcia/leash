// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// MID-RUN STEERING FOR BACKGROUND WORKERS: the pure half.
//
// A background worker used to be unreachable the instant it was dispatched: its
// stdin was closed at spawn, so the only way to change its instructions was
// `kill -TERM` plus a full re-dispatch with a new brief. Measured 2026-09-03:
// that happened twice in one morning, each time within minutes of dispatch,
// each time throwing away a warm context that had already read the repo.
//
// The chat lane never had that problem, it holds stdin open and writes a
// stream-json user message into the running child. This module is what lets a
// background worker be addressed the same way from outside the daemon: a local
// control socket takes `{op:'steer', target, text}`, resolves the target
// against the live workers, and the daemon writes the framed message into that
// worker's stdin.
//
// Everything here is PURE on purpose: target resolution, framing, validation
// and rendering are the parts that can be wrong in ways a live smoke test would
// not reveal, and bridge.mjs cannot be imported by a test (it boots the daemon
// on import). The daemon owns only the socket and the run registry.
//
// bg.mjs deliberately does NOT import this file: it is a standalone CLI that
// gets copied into a temp dir by its own test, so it carries its own copy of
// the one shape it needs (TARGET_SHAPE). bg-steer.test.mjs asserts the two
// copies have not drifted.

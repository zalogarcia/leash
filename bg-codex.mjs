// CODEX: THE SECOND ENGINE
//
// Leash runs on Claude. When every Claude account is rate limited, the
// background lane stops and the chat lane answers nothing: rotationPausedUntil
// is set, workers are told to stand down, and the owner waits. That wall is an
// ACCOUNT limit, not a machine limit, and a machine can have a second coding
// agent installed (OpenAI Codex, `codex exec`) on completely separate billing.
//
// So there are two reasons to spawn Codex instead of Claude:
//   1. because someone asked for it (/codex from Telegram, `bg.mjs --engine
//      codex`, a `codex:` prefix): a cross-family second opinion is worth more
//      than the same model reviewing itself;
//   2. because Claude cannot run at all right now, and a degraded answer beats
//      silence.
//
// This module is the PURE half of that: command assembly, routing decision,
// result parsing, and the wording of what the owner and the assistant are told.
// bridge.mjs owns
// the spawning and the sockets. Nothing in here reads a file, spawns a process
// or knows a path: every location arrives as an argument, which is what makes
// it testable without a daemon (bg-codex.test.mjs).
//
// SECURITY NOTE, non-negotiable: this module never touches the Codex
// credentials. `codex` finds its own auth in ~/.codex/auth.json; the child
// simply inherits the daemon's environment. Nothing here reads, prints, logs or
// forwards an API key, and no key is ever written into an argv array (which
// would land in `ps` output and in the run registry).
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

// The codex-cli version every flag in this file was measured against. Not
// decoration: `codex exec resume` accepting neither -C nor --sandbox, `review`
// rejecting --color, and `-i` being repeatable are all facts about ONE build,

// The boot canary compares `codex --version` against this and logs one line.

 * does not have: subagents, a model pin, this Mac's MCP servers, a Claude Code
 * slash command. None of that is an error the CLI can report; it is a page of
 * instructions billed by the token and then improvised around.
 *
 * Returns a list of warnings, never throws, and refuses nothing: the caller
 * decides what to do with them. Today exactly one caller does, the daemon's
 * drop-box path, which prepends them to the handoff notice. bg.mjs does NOT
 * print them: it imports nothing but node builtins on purpose, and buying the
 * warning at dispatch time would cost that for a line the daemon prints a

 *   chat   sandbox from /yolo         the interactive lane; resumes a thread.
 *
 * Measured against codex-cli 0.153.0 on 2026-09-03, on top of the review facts
 * below:
 *   - `codex exec resume <id>` has NO -C, NO --sandbox and NO --color. The
 *     sandbox goes through `-c sandbox_mode=<mode>` (verified with
 *     `codex doctor -c sandbox_mode=workspace-write`, and by a resumed run
 *     refusing a write under `-c sandbox_mode=read-only`), and the cwd comes
 *     from the child process.
 *   - `--ephemeral` persists no session, so a run that will be resumed must
 *     never carry it.
 *   - `--approve-for-me` is NEVER emitted. `codex exec` refuses it together
 *     with --sandbox (exit 2), and on its own it auto-approves the model's own
 *     escalations: a run rooted at /tmp used it to write into $HOME. It is a
 *     soft bypass flag.
 *
 * Measured against codex-cli 0.153.0 on 2026-09-03:
 *   - `codex exec review` takes NO -C and NO --sandbox (it is read-only by
 *     construction and reads the repo from the process cwd), so the caller sets
 *     cwd on the child instead.
 *   - `codex exec review` REJECTS --color; plain `codex exec` accepts it.
 *   - `--uncommitted` and a [PROMPT] argument are mutually exclusive, so a
 *     review with custom instructions carries no scope flag.
 *   - the prompt is delivered as `-` (stdin), never as an argv string: a brief
 *     in argv loses its backticks to the shell, the same failure that made
 *     `bg.mjs --file` exist.
 *
 * NEVER emits --dangerously-bypass-approvals-and-sandbox. `codex exec` already
 * runs with approval policy "never" (nothing can prompt), so the sandbox mode
 * is the only thing between the model and the filesystem.

// The daemon's own voice: every message the bridge writes about itself.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. An audit of all 88 texts the daemon sends on its own
// (2026-09-04) found one shape per author rather than one shape per product:
// bold headers on top of emoji, dashes and middle dots as separators in the
// same line, column-aligned key/value blocks that a proportional font ragged
// out, and 17 waits that sent a sentence which was true when it left and stale
// a minute later with no way to tell "still working" from "died".
//
// So the rules live HERE, as functions, rather than in prose beside 88 call
// sites:
//
//   1. Icon first, then label, then value. The icon is the scan target.
//   2. One fact per line. A line answering two questions is two lines.
//   3. The middle dot is the only in-line separator. Never a dash.
//   4. No em or en dashes in a source string. dash-normalize.mjs catches them
//      outbound, but it turns each one into a comma, which is not always the
//      punctuation the sentence wanted, and a public install starts with the
//      normalizer OFF.
//   5. Target 40 characters a line. Telegram's bubble font wraps at 44 and a
//      wrapped line reads as a paragraph.
//   6. Bold marks exactly one thing per message, the state word. Nothing else.
//   7. Reference material goes in an expandable blockquote, never inline.
//   8. A wait is ONE message, edited in place to its terminal state.
//
// Pure string functions, no daemon state, no Telegram, no clock unless it is
// passed in: this is the part that was wrong, so it is the part that has to be
// testable without a token. See system-messages.test.mjs.

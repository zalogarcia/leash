// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// DETACHED BACKGROUND WORKERS — so the daemon dying stops being a worker dying.
//
// A background worker used to be an ordinary child of the daemon, and THREE
// separate things tied its life to the daemon's:
//   1. it sat in the daemon's process group, so it took every signal aimed at
//      the daemon (launchctl kickstart -k, safe-restart, a crash-loop kill);
//   2. its stdout was a PIPE to the daemon, so the moment the daemon died the
//      worker's next write hit a broken pipe and killed it — detaching ALONE
//      does not fix this;
//   3. its outcome was only ever recorded by `child.on('close')`, a handler that
//      needs the daemon alive to run at all.
//
// Measured 2026-08-02: a safe-restart timed out over a live child and restarted.
// A 5-piece video job died mid-composite — four outputs left unverified, one a
// truncated mp4 with no moov atom, one piece never started, no report written.
// The owner found it, not the daemon. It had happened repeatedly before.
//
// The watchdog half of this module DETECTS that. The spawn half PREVENTS it:
//   • own process group (detached: true) — daemon signals never reach the worker
//   • stdout/stderr to a FILE, not a pipe — nothing left to break when the
//     daemon dies
//   • stdin written once and then LEFT OPEN, so the daemon can steer the worker
//     mid-run (2026-09-03; it used to be closed at spawn, which made a
//     dispatched worker unreachable and turned every correction into a kill plus
//     a re-dispatch that threw the warm context away). This does not re-couple
//     the worker to the daemon: when the daemon dies the kernel closes its write
//     end, the worker reads EOF, which is exactly what it used to get at spawn,
//     and the CLI exits on that EOF, so a detached worker still finishes alone.
//     The daemon ends stdin itself on the result event. Section 9 of
//     detached-workers.test.mjs proves the orphan case with its control, and
//     scripts/probes/steer-probe-B.mjs proves it against the real binary.
//   • the daemon reads results by TAILING that file, and re-attaches to any
//     still-running worker at startup (see createWorkerWatchdog/reattachLiveWorkers)
//
// Do NOT "simplify" this back to pipes. Pipes are what killed the video job.
// The chat lane deliberately keeps the old shape: it is interactive, the owner
// watches it live, and its output belongs in a Telegram bubble rather than a
// file. Steering is no longer what separates the two lanes; stdio is.
//

// This module is SHARED VERBATIM between the public and private bridge repos
// (see scripts/check-shared.sh, which fails the build if the two copies drift).
// That is only possible because it owns no paths and no prose: every filesystem
// location arrives as an argument, and every user-visible message is produced by
// an injected callback. Keep it that way — if you find yourself reaching for a
// repo-level global or writing an owner-specific string in here, inject it
// instead.

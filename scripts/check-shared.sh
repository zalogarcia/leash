# Fail if any SHARED module has drifted between the public and private bridge
# repos.
#
# Some modules are deliberately identical in both repos: they own no paths, no
# credentials and no owner-specific prose, so the same bytes ship in both places.
# That property is only worth anything if something checks it — a prose rule
# saying "keep these in sync" decays the first time someone is in a hurry.
#
# The two bridge.mjs files are NOT shared and never will be: the public one
# carries a config layer (conf()/config.json/install.sh) that the private one
# does not. Only the modules listed below are expected to match.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/check-shared.sh                 # compare against the sibling repo
#   BRIDGE_SIBLING_REPO=/path ./scripts/check-shared.sh
#
# Exits 0 when every shared module matches, 1 on any difference, 2 if the
# sibling repo cannot be found.

# NOT LISTED, and why. These modules came from the private sibling and behave
# the same way, but they have DIVERGED and cannot be byte-identical. Two
# separate reasons, kept apart because only the first one is ever going away:
#
# (a) The private copies name the owner and his machine, and a public repo
#     cannot repeat that. Byte-identity waits on the private side being
#     genericized, not on anything here:
#
#       bg-steer.mjs        + its test   (the steer framing names the assistant)
#       codex-account.mjs   + its test   (comments; a city in one of them)
#       bg-codex.mjs        + its test   (comments; a hardcoded default timezone,
#                                        which here means the machine's own)
#       reply-quote.mjs     + its test   (comments and fixtures name the owner and
#                                        the private daemon's own name)
#       peers.mjs           + its test   (comments and pane fixtures name the
#                                        owner's own sessions, repos and clients)
#       bg-btw.mjs          + its test   (the private framing hard-codes the
#                                        assistant's name; here the daemon names
#                                        itself from config.json, and the test
#                                        fixtures name public repos)
#
# (b) This repo carries fixes the private one does not, found by the QA pass on
#     the port (2026-09-04). Listing these would make the gate demand that the
#     private repo REGRESS to match:
#
#       bg-codex.mjs        codexParkedNote clips both halves of a parked pair;
#                           unclipped, ten `--file` briefs plus ten Codex answers
#                           go into one prompt when the wall lifts
#       bg-steer.mjs        carries parseRunId, which lives in the private
#                           bg-notify.mjs (a module this repo does not have)
#
#       bg-codex-wiring.test.mjs   harness stubs differ throughout (no full-report
#                                  file here), plus the sections covering the two
#                                  fixes above
#
# bg-lane-rules.mjs and bg.mjs are public-only shapes and are not candidates:
# bg.mjs carries this repo's config layer, and the private repo has no
# bg-lane-rules.mjs at all (its stripLaneRules, briefTitle and briefRepo live in
# bg-notify.mjs alongside owner-specific notice text).
